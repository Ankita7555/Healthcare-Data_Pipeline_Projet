# Healthcare-Data_Pipeline_Projet
End-to-end Healthcare Data Engineering pipeline designed around HL7 FHIR interoperability and HIPAA-compliant data processing. The project simulates enterprise healthcare architectures by ingesting FHIR patient resources, applying PHI masking, transforming nested EHR data into structured models, and loading datasets into BigQuery using Airflow.
